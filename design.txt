Design for Assignment 5

Compute:
- store temporary array storing perfect numbers found in current iteration of
numbers
- store modulus operations executed
- store time taken to execute modulus operations
- query manage for next range of values
- send hostname on which it is being run to manage
- send mod/sec to manage after completing computation
- send number being tested to manage before determining whether it is a perfect
number

Manage:
- store compute process hostnames
- store mods per sec for each process
- store all perfect numbers found
- store current number being tested for each compute process
- send number range to compute processes
- send kill signals to compute processes

Report:
- print out perfect numbers found
- print out numbers currently being tested by each compute process
- print out hostnames of each compute process
- retrieve perfect numbers found from manage process
- retrieve numbers currently being tested from manage process
- retrieve hostnames of each compute process from manage process
